Johann Karl Friedrich Zollner created it in the 1800s. The illusion is a geometrical-optical illusion, or an illusion where a central line appears distorted due to interference. It features parallel lines hashed by diagonal lines which make the parallel lines appear that they are not in fact parallel (Donaldson, 2017). The current theory of why the lines appear distorted is based on inhibitory interactions in the visual cortex (Wallace, 1975). In an experiment by Akiyoshi Kitaoka and Masami Ishihara, researchers found that three smaller illusions featured within the Zollner illusion are driven by inhibitory interactions and combine to create the Zollner illusion. The first is the acute-angle expansion illusion. The lower limit of the angle causing the illusion is 36 degrees, which is lower than similar illusions like the tilt illusion (Kitaoka, 2000). These expanding acute angles are thought to have a more local effect. The effectiveness of the smaller angles might also be because of the larger complement angles they create driving the illusion. The acute-angle contraction mechanism might have a similar effect where the complementary large angles enhance the distortion of the parallel lines (Kitaoka, 2000). The contracting angles are suggested to have a more global effect. The symmetrical configuration is also a possible driver of the illusion. Researchers found that the expansion only clearly appeared in symmetrical figures (Kitaoka, 2000). These factors are synthesized in the brain as contributing to the illusion because these angle and symmetry pairings likely stimulate neurons that have opposite orientations, and some of the orientations are dominant and respond more, making the parallel lines appear to bulge and contract. Researchers have already studied some variations on this experiment. Akiyoshi Kitaoka and Masami Ishihara investigated how different numbers of lines affect the effect of the illusion. They found that there was little difference in results even if the frequency of the hashes changed (Kitaoka, 2000). They were unable to explain why there was no qualitative difference, which begs more research on this illusion. Other researchers investigated how color impacts visual illusions more generally. They found that multiple colors can create shifts in cone representation (M\\xE9ly, 2018). Opposite colors also can have an inhibitory effect, which could contribute to shifts in perception. Color and orientation also was found to have a strong relationship which may be caused by neurons tuned to contrasts in color and orientation being close to each other in the visual cortex (Clifford, 2003). For my final project, I would like to investigate shifts in perception due to color in the context of the Zollner illusion. While the literature does investigate differences in visual illusions due to color generally and variations in the Zollner illusion specifically, no one (to my knowledge) has investigated how color could affect the Zollner illusion. I would like to investigate how the effect of the illusion changes based on background color, color of the hashes, and the color of the long parallel lines. I could also try making the hashes different colors. References Clifford, C. W., Spehar, B., Solomon, S. G., Martin, P. R., & Qasim, Z. (2003).
